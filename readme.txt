Installation:

The Web SIB explorer does not require any installation, it does however depend on some Python packages.
To install those, follow the instructions in "requirements.txt"

Running:

To run it type "python explorer.py" or if you are on Windows, you can simply type "explorer.py".

Problems:

This program has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit, but should work on any platform
supporting Python 2.7.

This program has NOT been tested with Python 3

If you run into any problems, feel free to contact me at frank.wickstrom@abo.fi.

Note:
Debugging is left to "True" as this will yield a proper traceback if anything goes wrong.
If you send any bug reports, please include the traceback (easiest to just include the complete HTML file created upon crashes)
